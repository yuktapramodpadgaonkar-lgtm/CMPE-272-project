    <h1>About Sweet Crumb</h1>
    <p>Sweet Crumb Homemade Cookies started in a home kitchen with a simple goal: to share the kind of cookies we grew up with—crispy edges, chewy centers, and recipes that don’t rely on anything artificial.</p>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>What began as weekend baking for family and friends turned into a small business when neighbors and coworkers kept asking for more. We opened our kitchen to the community and have been baking by order ever since.</p>
    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quality:</strong> We use real butter, pure vanilla, and carefully sourced ingredients.</li>
      <li><strong>Small batches:</strong> Every order is baked in small batches for consistency and freshness.</li>
      <li><strong>Community:</strong> We love being part of the local food scene and supporting other small businesses.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Where We Are</h2>
    <p>We operate from San Jose, California, and serve the greater Bay Area with pickup and local delivery. Visit our <a href="contacts.php">Contacts</a> page for address, hours, and how to reach us.</p>
